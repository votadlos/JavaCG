Objective:

    This is a simple example shows how out parameters are used and
    implemented. Out parameters defined in the IDL constructs are mapped to
    corresponding XXXHolder classes generated by the IDL compiler. This demo
    has out parameters of various types, e.g. multidimensional string arrays
    and structs.
